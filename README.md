# Mosquito Body Analysis Shiny App 

Hello and welcome to my github repository which houses my mosquito body analysis
shiny app. 

I chose option B - my own shiny app, which can be accessed on this link: 
https://marquenis.shinyapps.io/shiny-marquenis/

### Repository contents

In this repository, I have 
1. A README.md file explaining the contents of this respository.
2. An app.R file which contains the script for the shiny app.
3. A togoi.csv file which contains the data used for the analyses.
4. The shiny-marquenis.Rproj file.

### Data explanation
This app is unique because it provides an easy user-interface where you can 
explore the different body sizes of mosquitoes from different larval growing 
conditions.

In this data set, we are using wing length as a proxy for body size. The 
larva were divided into 5 different treatments, where both temperature and 
nutrition levels were manipulated. 

Mosquitoes body size manipulation follows a general rule of thumb. You can 
increase body size by either 1) decreasing the temperature, or 2) increasing 
nutrition levels. Body size can be decreased through 1) increasing temperatures
or 2) decreasing nutrition levels.

The 5 treatments in this experiment are 24C medium nutrition, 24C high 
nutrition, 24C low nutrition, 30C medium nutrition, and 18C medium nutrition. 

#### Data acknowledgement
This data was collected during the summer of 2020 by a work-learn student, 
Ernest Liang. Both Ernest and I are now working together to analyze and 
publish our findings.
